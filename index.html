		<h1>Hello!</h1>
		as you can see they got bombarded with kilroy jokes and Y2K.<br>
		Y2K events are already ended, "kilroy was here" are just dead jokes.<br>
		they copied and pasted 125 times.<br>
		So, i cleaned up. please, don't do this ever again.<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Sincerely, ~lykakspars</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I'm rather fond of "Kilroy was here" as it's a World War 2 cultural reference. However anything
    repeated 128 times is bad news :)</p>
    <br>
    <p>How's about a skateboarding bulldog instead? :)</p>
